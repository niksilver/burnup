# Developing

## Setup

To set yourself up
install [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/clasp/#0](clasp),
the Google Apps Script commandline tool. Then log in:

```
% clasp login
```

## Working with the code

Pull the code down from Google if you think you're out of sync:

```
clasp pull
```

When you want to update Google, push your code:

```
clasp push
```

Before running the tests, first make sure you're in the script editor:
from the spreadsheet go to `Tools > Script editor`.

To run the tests in the script editor, first make sure you've got `Tests 0 - All.gs` open
and click the `Play` icon (a triangle) and then click `View > Logs`.
